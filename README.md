## Running Object Detection

To perform object detection using TurtleBot images:  

1. **Start the camera node** on your TurtleBot:  
   _(Ensure the TurtleBot is powered on and the camera node is running in a separate terminal.)_  

2. **Launch the detection pipeline** on your VM:  
   ```sh
   ros2 launch image_processing_pkg detection_pipeline_launch.py
   ```  

This will initiate the object detection process using images captured by the TurtleBot.
